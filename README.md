Original instructions can be found [here](https://naomitague.github.io/ESM232_course/assignments/almond_yield_function.html). 

## Motivation and project goal
This assignment draws from the article, [Impacts of future climate change on California perennial crop yields: Model projections with climate and crop uncertainties by Lobell et al. (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016819230600308X). Lobell et al. (2006) build statistical models to predict crop yields of 6 major perennial crops in California:
1. wine grapes
2. almonds
3. table grapes
4. oranges
5. walnuts
6. and avocados. 

The **project goal** is to recreate a simple almond yield prediction model and predict average almond yield (tons/acre) from 1988 to 2010 based on temperature and precipitation data. 

## Intended purpose and important concepts
As this project is intended for educational purposes, the student authors practiced the following:
- building functions in R 
- sourcing R scripts into RMarkdown files 

## Future research

## Installation
The following **packages** were utilized during this analysis:
- `here`
- `lubridate`
- `tidyverse`

## Data

Model parameter values were taken from [Lobell et al. (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016819230600308X). Climate data were source from [here](https://github.com/naomitague/ESM232_Examples/tree/main/Data).
